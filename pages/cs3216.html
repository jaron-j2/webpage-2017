					<h1 class="section-title">VIDEO DESCRIPTION</h1>
					<p id="vid-des" class="section-text mx-auto"> Through sheer perseverance, diligence and focus had I attained a good grasp at web-development. Currently familiar with HTML5, jQuery and attempting to learn PHP. Started off as an interest and the thought that it is a "good skill to have", I am refining my development skills and learning new syntax everyday. If I accomplished so much in such a short span, I am looking forward to what I can offer in the future. I may not be the best developer now, but one day I will be.</p>
