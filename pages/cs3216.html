					<h1 class="section-title">VIDEO DESCRIPTION</h1>
					<p id="vid-des" class="section-text mx-auto">The future has always been shaped by thinkers and innovators. As children, many big dreams and big ideas. As many grow old, they lose those dreams. But why? Be it society, education, finances or lack of guidance, there are many factors that inhibit our aspiriations. And even without constraints, constantly changing demands and markets further limits our success. Yet, although we may not be able to guarantee our successes, there are measures to increase our chances. In CS3216, the curriculum serves to take us closer to achieve those goals. As with Bill Gates quote on software innovation, CS3216 emphasises collaboration, sharing of ideas and knowing the needs of your audience. From working together with people of various disciplines and development of real applications, CS3216 provides the foundation to succeed at my own dream start-up.</p>

					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">It takes instinct to be a successful marketer, not simply knowledge imparted by books or academic modules. Having been honed by working closely on the ground, being multi-disciplinary, and being able to analyse broader perspectives, I am a skilled communicator who knows how to peak the interests of others - qualities vital to being a good marketer. Expand the section for the framework I always commit to, ensuring success at any marketing campaigns.</p>

					<h1 class="steps-title">1. SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS</h1>
					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">Stepping out of the brain-storming stage with a concrete idea, the next step to successfully pitching your idea is to analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of your project. This step in the strategic marketing process helps to break down resources that can be built on and prepare for potential challenges. First, you need to analyze your product’s features and decide how they distinguish your product from its competitors. Second, decide what type of buyer is most likely to purchase your product. What are you selling? Convenience? Quality? Discount pricing? You can’t offer it all. Knowing what your customers want helps you decide what to offer and market.</p>

					<h1 class="steps-title">2. TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">Describing and know your target audience is the next fundamental step. What are the demographics: age, sex, socioeconomic background, lifestyle? Specify these details in a paragraph and always refer back to it, only then will you be familiar with what and how much they will use your platform. If the idea is a business-to-business one, the target audience has to be defined based on the type of business and size. Go down to the ground to collect more data from them to determine if your product will indeed be of their interest. Apply quantitative analysis to optimise your business direction. No matter who your target audience is, be sure to narrowly define them; it will be the guide to all your planned media and outreach campaigns.</p>

					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">Set marketing goals and objectives to serve as litmus tests and focus. Notably, two factors are the most critical: magnitude and time. List down your specific goals to hit and specify when it has to be met. For example, aiming for 20 percent increase in page views within 1 week. With this list of measurable goals—and make them you’ll know when you’ve achieved them or not, serving as an internal feedback to change business directions.</p>

					<h1 class="steps-title">4. COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES</h1>
					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">What tactics will you use to accomplish those goals? A good marketing plan will have plans for all stages of development and implementation. Beginning with lead generation, how will hype be generated for your project even before release? Media is the foundation of communication. In an age of digital platforms, you have to be familiar with what captures attention on social media and the aesthetics of your campaigns and product. To identify your ideal marketing mix, determine what forms of media your target audience turns to for information. Be targetted and express what best encapsulates your product - again, know your target audience.</p>

					<h1 class="steps-title">5. RISK EVALUATION</h1>
					<p class="section-text roles-text mx-auto">Know your returns. As resources are constantly scarce, be it financial, manpower or time, it is highly important to priortise where those resources go. The most efficient method is to conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis. Knowing your budget and resources, project what is the potential growth in your endeavour. Effectively, such measures are absolutely essential to the success of your business. And with so many different kinds of tactics available for reaching out to your target audience, determine how to best use your resources. Never exceed what you cannot afford.</p>

Being someone who is business-savvy, full of foresight and adept at interacting with consumers, I certainly hope to work with the best minds in CS3216 to realise the best applications and immense market penetration.</p>
